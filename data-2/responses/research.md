# Developing a Protocol to Verify Image Authenticity

## Problem
With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and its ability to generate highly realistic images, there is a growing need to develop a protocol that can help distinguish between genuine and AI-generated images. This would entail tracking the source of the image and any edits made to it. Ensuring the authenticity of an image is crucial in various fields, including news and media, legal proceedings, copyright protection, and personal privacy.

## Possible Solutions
The proposed protocol involves using an attested camera sensor to cryptographically sign an image, demonstrating that it was captured by a camera rather than being algorithmically generated. In addition, this protocol will track all edits made to the image by saving the changes in metadata.

## Competitors and Existing Technologies
- [Facebook embedding tracking data inside photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/cldrye/facebook_is_embedding_tracking_data_inside_photos/)
- [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Registry/Tasks/registrysigningimages.htm) for cryptographically signing container images
- [CodeSign Secure](https://www.globalsign.com/en/ssl/code-signing/) for secure and flexible code signing
- Image forensics techniques such as Error Level Analysis (ELA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Use Cases
1. News and media outlets can use the protocol to verify the authenticity of images before publishing, reducing the spread of misinformation and manipulated content.
2. Legal proceedings can rely on the protocol to distinguish between genuine evidence and fabricated images.
3. Copyright holders can track the source of images and edits made to protect their intellectual property rights.

## Trends
1. Increased use of artificial intelligence in generating realistic images, video, and text
2. Growing awareness and adoption of cryptographic techniques for image authentication
3. Developments in AI algorithms and neural networks for image forgery detection

In conclusion, the development of a protocol to verify image authenticity is becoming increasingly important as AI-generated content becomes more prevalent. By leveraging attested camera sensors, cryptographic techniques, and metadata tracking, this proposed protocol can help users determine the origin of an image and any alterations made to it. By identifying genuine and AI-generated content, we can promote truth and authenticity in various industries and applications.
