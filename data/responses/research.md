# Market Research Summary

### Market Fit

The demand for distinguishing genuine images from AI-generated ones is increasing, as AI-generated images have become more realistic and convincing. The proposed protocol to track the source of images through attested camera sensor and metadata tracking will cater to end-users who need to verify the authenticity and editing history of images, particularly in industries like news & media, entertainment, content creation, and online communities.

### Competitors

1. Researchers at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory: While not direct competitors, they are developing forgery detection techniques to distinguish between original and fake paintings using backpropagation neural networks.
2. Image forensics platforms and challenges: IEEE's Information Forensics and Security Technical Committee (IFS-TC) is launching a detection and localization forensics challenge for verifying image authenticity.
3. AI research: GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) and other AI techniques are focused on generating more realistic images. These developments in AI-generated content will raise the demand for verification solutions.

### Existing Technologies

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Used for detecting fake images, achieving high detection accuracies in fine-tuned models.
2. Blockchain-based image verification: The use of cryptographic signing methods to ensure the authenticity of images, such as ImageSign or the Play Integrity API by Google's Android.
3. MetaPho and other metadata editing applications: These tools allow users to view, edit, and remove image metadata, which can be incorporated into the tracking process for our proposed solution.
4. Photomath and other identity verification projects: Using machine learning technologies for image validation by comparing against specific requirements.

### Trends in the Space

1. Adoption of deep learning techniques: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are increasingly being used for image generation and detection tasks.
2. Increase in data privacy concerns: There is growing awareness about metadata tracking in images, leading to more demands for tools and protocols that can verify image authenticity and track editing history.
3. Advancements in AI-generated content: AI-generated images are becoming more realistic, raising the need for systems that can efficiently differentiate between genuine and AI-generated images.
4. Blockchain-based solutions: Cryptographic signing and distributed ledger technologies are being explored and adopted for secure image verification and content sharing.
