They note that the degree of variation of gray tones reflects a painter's particular style and are using power spectrum data to detect this. A backpropagation neural network is then used for classification, with two output units indicating whether it is an original or a fake. This research is being conducted by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative.",
    "1": "A study investigated humans' ability to detect and locate manipulations in real-world photos and found that physically implausible changes were easier to detect than plausible ones. An algorithmic protocol is being developed to distinguish if an image was taken by a camera or generated algorithmically and track all edits made. The study assessed market fit, competitors and existing technologies in the image manipulation space for this protocol. The study used real-world scenes, where some were manipulated, and found that people have the ability to detect and locate manipulations, but performance is far from perfect. The amount of change in an image affects people's accuracy in detecting and locating manipulations. Finally, individual factors like belief in the prevalence of manipulated photos affect the accuracy of people in detecting manipulations.",

CNN's are used to extract features that are meaningful for classification from images fed to the network. The IEEE Information Forensics and Security Technical Committee (IFS-TC) launched a detection and localization forensics challenge to provide an open dataset of digital images comprising of images taken under different lighting conditions and forged images to solve the problem of verifying the authenticity of images. The dataset had fake images created using techniques like Content-Aware Fill and PatchMatch (for copy/pasting), Content-Aware Healing (for copy/pasting and splicing), Clone-Stamp (for copy/pasting), and Seam carving (image retargeting). The authors used a custom CNN architecture to detect fake images and also tried transfer learning, using the weights of a pre-trained model, VGG16 network trained on ImageNet dataset to vectorize images in their dataset. The authors fine-tuned the last convolutional layer of the pre-trained model and achieved a good detection accuracy of 94.65% for the fine-tuned VGG16 model and 95.09% for the fine-tuned ResNet50 model on the test set.",

Image-retouching, image splicing, image resampling, and compression-based forgery detection methods are discussed in detail. Moreover, to detect compression-based forgery, chromatic aberration, color filter arrays, source camera abbreviation, and sensor imperfection are used while lighting discrepancies are used to reveal evidence of tampering and splicing.

    "1": "Cryptographic image signing can be used to verify that an image has not been modified since it was published. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry enables users to push images and sign them using a master encryption key obtained from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault, creating an image signature. A signed image can have multiple signatures, each created using a different key. Clients can be configured to only pull signed images from the registry. The steps to store signed images in Container Registry include building the image, pushing the image and obtaining the OCID of the image and the master encryption key. The image can then be signed using the master key and key version in the Vault service, creating an image signature. The signature can be viewed, verified or deleted and the Vault service can be used to confirm that the master encryption key used to sign the image is still valid.",
    "2": "Image signing is a process of signing digital images to confirm the software's authenticity and safeguard against any malicious activity. The process involves hashing an original image, signing it with a private key, and packing it with a digital certificate. On the client side, the image is passed through a hashing algorithm, the public key is extracted from the certificate, and both the hashes are compared to ensure that the image has not been changed. Weaknesses in image signing include improper management of private keys and threats of obtaining a trusted certificate. To prevent these weaknesses, best practices should be put in place, such as using Hardware Security Modules or HSMs, applying the principle of least privilege, and showing a warning or completely blocking untrusted certificates during installation. CodeSign Secure provides a secure and flexible solution to organizations' code signing needs.",
    "3": "A proposed protocol to determine whether an image is authentic or AI-generated involves two processes: tracking the source of the image using a camera sensor that signs an image with a digital fingerprint, and keeping track of any edits to the image by storing them in metadata. The steps for enabling image signing and verification vary and involve modifying configuration files, verifying that ImageSign and ImageSignClaim custom resources have been created with specific attributes set to true and bound to nodes, and synchronizing machine config pools. Instructions are given on how to import insecure certificates, create roles and secret configurations, and enable image verification. There are scenarios provided that involve two clusters for image signing and verification using public keys and the same registry. Tutorials are provided for modifying ImageSign CR to disable image verification or pulling images to local image cache without verifying the signature.",
    "4": "Container image signing is a process of adding a digital signature to a container image to verify its authenticity and integrity. It can be done using public key infrastructure or other cryptographic methods. Secure software supply chain is essential for ensuring the security and trustworthiness of software, and it is important to implement security measures at every stage of the process. The sigstore project is an open-source tool for storing and verifying cryptographic signatures. Cosign is a tool developed by the Sigstore project for signing and verifying software packages.",
    "5": "Smart cards are a more secure means of storing private keys than storing them on a computer; a smart card cannot be activated without providing a PIN, thus providing two-factor authentication. Readers with a numeric keypad that circumvent the eavesdropping threat posed by keystroke loggers can also be used. The semantic interpretation of digital signatures can be changed if the digital document is changed between the time of signature and verification, undermining the credibility of digital signatures. Legislation exists in a number of countries to endorse digital signatures and provide for their legal effect, whilst some industries have developed interoperability standards for the use of digital signatures. Signing and encryption keys should be separate to reduce legal implications of encryption."

To assess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images, the author created an application for readers to practice identifying fake and real photographs.",
    "1": "An experiment found that 87% of respondents mistook an AI-generated image for a real photo, and AI-generated faces are usually very symmetrical and lack uniqueness. The AI struggles with replicating unique or unusual elements, and both human writers and artists still outperform AI. AI can be used to spread misinformation, but it is still difficult to use compared to traditional techniques.

The results of the survey differed between segments, but the differences were not drastic.",

However, more complex images still elude AI and need human input. The potential for AI-generated images to be used for deception is also discussed.

A survey conducted by the authors revealed that most people struggle to identify AI-generated content, and many elements appear as arguments for and against the text being written by AI. AI-powered photo manipulation can deceive viewers and pass off AI-generated photos as real, while AI-based image-to-text generators can create photorealistic images. AI can generate specific elements but still lags in the art of composition and creating more complex structures. Despite this, AI-based news presenters and AI-powered teachers might not be that bad.",

Attaining market fit, assessing competitors and existing technologies, and understanding the current state of this space is important for the assessment of an idea to develop a protocol that distinguishes between genuine and AI-generated images by tracking if the image was algorithmically generated and tracking the edits on the image.
