# Problem

As technology advances, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between genuine images and those generated by AI algorithms. These AI-generated images, often created using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), can be used for misinformation, art plagiarism, identity theft, and other malicious activities. The problem arises from the increasing challenge in determining the authenticity of images, ensuring their origin is from a legitimate camera and tracking the edits made on the image.

# Solutions

1. **Attested camera sensor:** One proposed solution is to use an attested camera sensor that cryptographically signs an image, thereby proving it was taken from a camera rather than generated by AI. This would help users determine the source of an image and its authenticity.

2. **Tracking image metadata:** Another solution is to store and track every edit made on an image within its metadata. This would allow users to verify the history of edits made on a particular image and assess its authenticity based on this information.

# Existing technologies and standards

1. **IPTC Photo Metadata standard:** This widely used industry standard defines metadata structure and fields to optimally describe images.

2. **PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other ML/DL libraries:** Various machine learning frameworks provide tools for working with images, including detection, classification, and verification of authentic and fake images.

3. **EXIF data:** A standard for storing digital photography information such as date and time, resolution, GPS coordinates, etc. EXIF data can be used to track information related to an image.

4. **Image Signing:** Cryptographically signing images using public key infrastructure or other cryptographic methods to verify their authenticity and integrity.

# Competitors

There are multiple research groups, academic institutions, and companies working in the field of image forgery detection and verification, including but not limited to The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under NASA Cooperative, IEEE Information Forensics and Security Technical Committee (IFS-TC), and various researchers focusing on deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

# Use-cases

1. Establishing the authenticity of images in news media to prevent the spread of misinformation.

2. Verifying the source and authenticity of art for copyright protection and preventing plagiarism.

3. Ensuring the integrity of images in forensic investigations and legal proceedings.

4. Preventing identity theft and fraud through the verification of images on documents such as passports and ID cards.

# Trends

1. ***Increased use of AI-generated images:*** As AI-based image generation techniques evolve, the number of AI-generated images is increasing.

2. ***Development of advanced image forgery detection techniques:
